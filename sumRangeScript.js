/*
   i asked chat GPT for a good name for this javascript file. 
   This was my prompt:
   what should i name a javascript file that runs this
    console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
    // â†’ 55

    i still have to write my own sum and range functions in this same file

    
    ChatGPT:
    You might name the file something like "sumRangeScript.js" to reflect 
    that it contains a script involving the sum and range functions
*/

console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
